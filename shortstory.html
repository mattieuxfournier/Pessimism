    <h2>Short Story: <span class="italic">The Elevator</span></h2>
    <p>
        At 8:03 each morning without fail, the elevator would open. Elias would step inside, press the button for the 17th floor, and finally leaned against the cold metallic wall. The elevator hissed and began to ascend. Muzak floated from a speaker above. Elias blinked.
    </p>
    <p>
        On the 4th, a woman came in. She nodded but never spoke. On the 7th, she exited. On the 10th, it stopped. No one was on it. Doors closed again. On the 13th, lights flickered. Elias watched the number light. It kept going up.
    </p>
    <p>
        On the 17th floor, the elevator never slowed. It just kept going. 18. 19. 20. Then 3. 4. 5. It went down again. But nothing was moving beyond the windows. The numbers just went round and round. The elevator itself had disappeared somewhere, but Elias didn't budge, only tilting slightly with the motion.
    </p>
    <p>
        Eventually, the buttons did not signify anything anymore. He started punching them randomly. They all lit up and stayed that way. The doors opened every now and then, but the floors were always empty of anyone. Just bland carpet, blinking lights, and nothing more. Then the doors closed again.
    </p>
    <p>
        His phone died, maybe on the second day. Maybe on the second hour. Time did not work the same in there. He ceased trying to keep pace.
    </p>
    <p>
        Sometimes he slept in the corner. Sometimes he woke up and screamed at the shiny ceiling. No one ever responded. Once, he thought he heard someone talking through the speaker, but it was just the motor.
    </p>
    <p>
        Hunger came and went. He accustomed himself to not expecting much. He accepted it. Soon enough, he even forgot what it's like to desire anything.
    </p>
    <p>
        The elevator was going. It just kept moving. Always going. Never arriving. Elias was going too. But he didn't feel like he was going anywhere. Wishing for something felt like hitting a button that had no effect.
    </p>
    <p>
        Maybe the elevator was a punishment. Maybe it was a test. But Elias didn't operate in those modes anymore. There were no answers here. Just the same over and over, and the recollection of a world in which things meant something.
    </p>
    <p>
        The lights started to dim slowly. Not all at once. A bit more each time. As though it was continually getting dark. He stood in front of the panel and looked up. Floor 12. Then 13. Then 14. Then 12 again.
    </p>
    <p>
        He smiled, barely. The elevator didn't mind. The world didn't mind. But it moved on. That was enough.

    <h2>Artist Statement</h2>
    <p>
      My short story, <span class="italic">The Elevator</span>, explores a kind of silent hopelessness consistent with the ideas of Arthur Schopenhauer and Albert Camus. The main character, Elias, is stuck in a world that never really goes anywhere. Things occur, yet nothing changes. That feeling of going through the motions without purpose is something I aimed to show through this strange, endless elevator ride.
    </p>
    <p>
      Schopenhauer believed that human life is directed by an insensate force named the Will and that the force always yearns for more. Because it is never satisfied, human beings are never satisfied either. In my story, Elias starts with a desire—to climb to the 17th floor—but when this becomes impossible, he must learn to accept the reality that he can't dictate much after all. As time goes on, he no longer desires anything. This is an application of what Schopenhauer wrote in <span class="italic">The World as Will and Representation</span>: "All striving springs from lack or deficiency, from dissatisfaction with one's condition." As soon as there is nothing anymore to desire, Elias is no longer attracted by the Will. At the same time, the story also applies to Camus' theory of the absurd.
    </p>
    <p>
      In <span class="italic">The Myth of Sisyphus</span>, Camus describes life as not really having any meaningful purpose, but yet people continue to seek it out. Elias' elevator doesn't stop, doesn't arrive, and nothing in it ever amounts to anything. It shows the same cyclical absurdity that Sisyphus performs, pushing a rock up a hill for all eternity. Camus states, "The struggle itself toward the heights is enough to fill a man's heart." I tried to illustrate something akin to that at the conclusion of the tale, when Elias smiles because nothing is making sense and nothing is working. He accepts the uselessness, and through that, it is acceptable.
    </p>
    <p>
      The elevator itself is symbolic of existing in a world that does not react. It is not ostentatious, not dramatic, but such is pessimism: quiet, mundane, and enduring. No respite, no relief. But I think the moment Elias abandons hope and simply endures the ride, something breaks. He does not triumph, but he is not broken also.
